Consider a constant annual return $R = 4.5\%$, semi-annually compounded (\textit{i.e.} two payments a year). 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item With an initial amount of $\$10000 $, what will be the value in:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 1 year?
        \item 5 years?
        \item 10 years?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What is the initial amount to have a final amount of $\$10000$ in:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 1 year?
        \item 3 years?
        \item 10 years?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item With an initial amount of $\$10000$, what will be the value in 1 year if the return was continously compounded?
    \item Optional : Let $R$ be the one-period return, $n$ the number of periods, and $m$ the number of payments per period. How would you prove that : \[ \lim_{m\to+\infty} (1 + \frac{R}{m})^{mn} = e^{Rn} \]
\end{enumerate}
