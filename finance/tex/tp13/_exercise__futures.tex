\subsection*{Futures valuation}

We consider a non-dividend-paying stock X that is valued at $S_0=100$ today and the risk free rate per annum is $r = 0.1$ and we assume the price $S_t$ of X to evolve along two scenarios as follows:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
    t [month] & price scenario 1 & price scenario 2 \\
\hline
$0$ & $100$ & $100$ \\
$2$ & $105$ & $99$  \\
$4$ & $104$ & $101$  \\
$6$ & $108$ & $98$ \\
$8$ & $113$ & $97$ \\
$10$& $109$ & $99$ \\
$12$& $112$ & $97$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We consider a futures with maturity $T = 12$ months. Compute the futures value $F_t$ at each date for both scenarios as time passes by. Plot the evolution of $S_t$ and $F_t$ on the same graph. What can you say about the way $F_t$ converges towards $S_T$?
