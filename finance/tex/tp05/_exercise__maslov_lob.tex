\section*{Limit Order Book - Maslov model}

The goal of this series is to implement Maslov model (\href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9910502.pdf}{check the paper for more details}), which allows to reproduce interesting stylized facts while being relatively simple. \\

\noindent We consider the following version of the model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item One trader at each time step.
    \item Buyer or seller, with probability $1 - q$ and $q$.
    \item Issues a market order (buy at ask / sell at bid) with probability $1 - r$ or a limit order with probability $r$. The price for the limit order is defined as $p - K$ when buying and $p + K$ when selling, with $p$ the market price, defined as the last price said in the market. K is a positive random variable.
    \item Each trader buys or sells a quantity of one.
    \item An order cannot be canceled.
    \item If an order cannot be executed (e.g. a sell market order but there is no buy order in the LOB), then nothing happens at this time step.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement the procedure above and unroll it for 1000 iterations. Use $q = r = 0.5$ and $K = 1$ with probability 1. Plot the time series of the market, ask, bid and mid prices $p(t), a(t), b(t)$ and $ m(t) = \frac{b(t) + a(t)}{2}$. Are there any difference between the mid and the market prices? 
    \item Plot the time series of returns of the market price, what do you observe?
    \item Plot the histogram of the values of this series. What can you say of this distribution? Is it a normal distribution?
    \item Plot and comment the ACF graph of this series. 
    \item Change the parameters of the model and try to explain how they influence the market.
\end{enumerate}
