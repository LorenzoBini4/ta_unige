\section{TWAP algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
    \item For each of the twenty starting times you picked, simulate the execution of the forementioned order with the TWAP algorithm, using 12 slices executed every 15 minutes.
    \item Compute the execution prices you got and compare them to the decision prices $\{\mathrm{ask}(t_i), \forall i \{1, \dots, 20\} \}$.
\end{itemize}
