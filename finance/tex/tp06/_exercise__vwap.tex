\section{VWAP algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Picking the same twenty starting times, simulate the execution of the forementioned order with the VWAP algorithm, using 12 slices executed every 15 minutes. You can use the daily distribution of ticks as historical data to estimate volumes traded in each 15 minutes interval. 
    \item Compute the execution prices you got and compare them to the decision prices and the TWAP prices.
\end{itemize}
