\section{Algorithm based on price evolution}

Finally, implement an execution algorithm that takes into account the price evolution. For instance, you can split the order in 12 equal slices and trade a slice at each downward directional change $\delta$. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Picking again the same initial times, compute the execution prices you got with this method and compare them with the ones previously obtained. 
    \item How should you choose $\delta$ in order to execute the full order over 3 hours?
\end{itemize}

\noindent Finally, feel free to try out other ideas. If you use price data, make sure not to make use of future prices.
