\section*{First steps}

The goal of this series is to implement different execution strategies and to see the different prices we would have obtained on real data. In the following exercises, we consider a fictitious order to \textbf{buy 12 million euros}. \\

\noindent We will again use the file \texttt{eur\_usd\_20120101\_20120301.txt} (download it on Moodle, series 3) that contains data on the EUR / USD exchange rate for the period of January 1st to March 1st 2012 and has the following data structure: \\

\begin{verbatim}
timestamp bid ask
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Similarly to previous series, load this file and remove the outliers (date in 1970). \\

\noindent Then, pick at random several times from the data (at least twenty). We will use them in the following exercises. \\
