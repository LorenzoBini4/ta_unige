\section*{First steps}
The goal of this series is to implement different execution strategies and to see the different prices we would have obtained on real data. In the following exercises, we consider a fictitious order to \textbf{buy 12 million euros}. \\

\noindent We will again use the file \texttt{eur\_usd\_20120101\_20120301.txt} (downloadable from Moodle, TP\_03) that contains data on the EUR / USD exchange rate from January 1st to March 1st 2012 and has the following data structure: \\

\begin{verbatim}
timestamp bid ask
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Similarly to the previous TPs, load this file and remove the outliers (date in 1970). \\

\noindent Then, pick several random time-intervals from the data (at least twenty). We will use them in the following exercises. \\
