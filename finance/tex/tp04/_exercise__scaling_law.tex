\section{Scaling law}
For this exercise, load the data provided in TP\_03 (EUR/USD, tick-by-tick, from \textbf{January 1st} to \textbf{March 1st 2012}). 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Plot the time series of mid-price against true time. 
    \item On the same graph, plot the directional changes for $\delta = 0.01$.
    \item Draw a log-log plot of the number of directional changes as a function of the scale $\delta$ for values of  $\delta \in [10^{-5}, 10^{-2}]$. What do you observe? 
\end{enumerate}
