\subsection*{General instructions}
\fontsize{11}{13}\selectfont
Each student is expected to upload on Moodle a \textbf{zip} file named as \textit{firstname\_lastname}, containing the followings: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item A report in \textbf{pdf} format to answer exercise questions.
    \item The \textbf{code} used to generate the results of the report. 
    \item If preferred, submit a unique \textbf{Jupyter notebook} with both code and report explanations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Deeper instructions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Report}: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Answers to the TP questions. Figures and numerical results are necessary but \textbf{strictly not} sufficient: provide your analysis/comments as well.
    \item Example: if your results surprise you, explain why and explain what the expected result was. 
    \item \textbf{Pay attention} to the presentation: axis labels, legend, etc. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation questions + code used to produce the results and figures in the report. 
        \item Programming language of your choice.
        \item Do not use ChatGPT, or any other LLM/AI-assisted tools while writing down your code. Try by yourself, otherwise it will be counted as failed.
        \item I \textbf{strongly recommend Python/Julia}: I won't be able to assist you in the same way if you use a different language.
    \end{itemize}
